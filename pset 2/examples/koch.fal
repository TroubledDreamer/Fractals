// Fractal definition of the Koch curve

fractal koch:
  draw self to X/3
  draw self to X/3 + 1/3 @60
  draw self to 2X/3
  draw self to X
  end

fractal koch2:
  let P = X/3
  let Q = X/3 + 1/3 @60
  let R = 2X/3
  draw self to P
  draw self to Q
  draw self to R
  draw self to X
end

// uncomment below after koch is working to draw a "snowflake"
// draw koch from O to 5X
// draw koch from 5X to 5X+5@-120
// draw koch to O
